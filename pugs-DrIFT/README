			     DrIFT

This package contains a source distribution of DrIFT, a tool for automatic
derivation of Haskell class instances. DrIFT was formerly known as Derive.

The current homepage is at:
    <http://repetae.net/john/computer/haskell/DrIFT/>


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Contents of this package:

  - src         Directory with the source files of the DrIFT tool
  - example     Directory with examples of using the DrIFT tool
  - docs        Documentation

------------------------------------------------------------------------------


If you have pulled the source from the darcs repository, you must first build
the autotools scripts by running

 $ autoreconf -i

To configure and install DrIFT from source or from Hackage, you have two options.


 AUTOTOOLS

You can install through the GNU Autools, like thus:

  $ ./configure --prefix=<dir>
  $ make install

Where <dir> is the directory in which you want to install the tool. Note that
a Haskell compiler (NHC or GHC) must be in your path. Otherwise, supply the
location of a Haskell compiler as follows:

  $ ./configure --prefix=<dir> --with-hc=<Haskell compiler>
  $ make install

 CABAL

You can also install through Cabal, the standard Haskell packaging tool with the usual set of commands:

      $ runhaskell Setup configure # optional --user --prefix=/home/user/bin
      $ runhaskell Setup build
      $ runhaskell Setup install # --user

(Remember, from Darcs requires autoreconf to have been run! If you are installing from Hackage, autoreconf should have already been run in the source tarball.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------


You may optionally set the environmental variable $DERIVEPATH to the list of directories you wish to search for modules.

An example:

 DERIVEPATH=/users/grad/nww/share/hugs/lib:/users/grad/nww/share/hugs/lib/hugs


to run DrIFT, simply pass the Haskell file name as an argument. You may run
'DrIFT --help' to get a summary of the various command line options
