History
-------
Development Taken over by John Meacham (john@foo.net) in April of 2002
  see ChangeLog for changes since 1.1

  (Changes by Malcolm.Wallace@cs.york.ac.uk, 1999)
Updated sources to Haskell 98.  Added derivation of class Binary and
class Haskell2Xml.  Changed Main.main to place results on stdout instead
of overwriting original file.  Have not tried using Makefile recently; I
use hmake instead.


Building DrIFT
--------------
depending on your system you should type one of the following:
hmake DrIFT 
make


Installation
------------
copy the 'DrIFT' executable to somewhere on your path

set DERIVEPATH to the list of directories you wish to search for  for
modules / interfaces. 

DERIVEPATH is quite fussy about the format the list should take :-
 * each path should be separated by ':'
 * no space inserted anywhere
 * no final '/' on the end of a path

e.g. 
good - /users/grad/nww/share/hugs/lib:/users/grad/nww/share/hugs/lib/hugs
bad - /users/grad/nww/share/hugs/lib/:/users/grad/nww/share/hugs/lib/hugs/


Running DrIFT
--------------
DrIFT foo.drift.hs -o foo.hs
DrIFT foo.hs -r -o foo_derivations.hs
