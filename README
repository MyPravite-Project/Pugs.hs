This repository hosts a Haskell-based implementation of Perl 6:

    http://perl6.org/

Currently it's mainly for historical/archival purposes and not
in active development; it's known to build under GHC 6.10 using
the standard "cabal install Pugs" process; see INSTALL for details.

The current goal is to maintain its installability for GHC 6.12
under the new Haskell Platform:

    http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/

Share and Enjoy!
