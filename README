This repository hosts a Haskell-based implementation of Perl 6.

Currently it's mainly for historical/archival purposes and not
yet in active development; it's known to build under GHC 6.10
using the standard "cabal install Pugs" process.

The current goal is to maintain its installability for GHC 6.12
under the new Haskell Platform:
