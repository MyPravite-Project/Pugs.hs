The current recommended way to build Pugs is via cabal-install with GHC 6.10.

Follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Cabal, HTTP, zlib and cabal-install installed
   (in this order):

    http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/Cabal
    http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/HTTP
    http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/zlib
    http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/cabal-install

If you're unsure how to install this, the instructions contained in the README
file of Cabal will help you get started. Those instructions work for all the
above packages.

2. Type the following commands:

    cabal update
    cabal install Pugs

...and you're done.  To build an optimized Pugs for benchmarking or smoke
testing, replace the second command with:

    cabal install -O2 Pugs

3. To upgrade the current Pugs installation to the latest released version,
   simply type the same two lines of commands above:

    cabal update
    cabal install Pugs
